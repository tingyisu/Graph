# Graph
A graph represented by an adjacency matrix. Includes methods that compute the number of edges, whether a cycle exists from a starting point, and the shortest path between two vertices. These methods are all within the single .java file in this repository. Most methods are done using DFS/BFS (Depth First Search/Breadth First Search).
